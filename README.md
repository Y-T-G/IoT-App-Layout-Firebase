**Name:** Yasin Mohammed  
**Matric No.:** 1814111

## App Description

The app uses Firebase Auth to authenticate the user. The user can register and then login using the email and password combination that they used to create their account. Once logged in, the user can add new IoT device, currently only ACs, by tapping the + icon. This would show a dialog that gets a list of brands and models from the [Energy Star Certified Room Air Conditioners](https://data.energystar.gov/Active-Specifications/ENERGY-STAR-Certified-Room-Air-Conditioners/rg68-9xmm) database. The user will need to provide a name for the device and then tap the 'Add' button to add it to the screen.
